# Places 

This folder contains the code of the Places app for Pepper.
This application can be installed on your robot via https://cloud.aldebaran-robotics.com/application/exploration-manager/

The Places app lets you annotate a map built by the robot with the Explore app to add remarkable places.
You can then save multiple maps for use in other applications such as Patrol app.

# Requirements

This application requires NAOqi 2.5.2+ and a Pepper robot.
In order to work, you might need Explore app from the same repo to explore an area and build a map.

# Getting started

Just start the application with a launcher or using the trigger sentence "Pepper Places" or "Show me the places".
The robot will then guide you through the steps to load the map and add interesting points in it.

# Notes 

All UI displayed during the app are placeholders and are heavily improvable.
